# Personal website

[![build](https://github.com/amarinkovic/amarinkovic.github.io/actions/workflows/pages-deploy.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/amarinkovic/amarinkovic.github.io/actions/workflows/pages-deploy.yml)

This repo contains the files for my personal website. It is a static site generated using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

To run the site locally for development purposes, execute this command:

```zsh
bundle exec jekyll s
```

Occasionally, I might publish a blog post on a specific topic I find interesting at the moment. Come check it out!
